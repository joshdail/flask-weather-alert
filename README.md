# Weather Alert

A demo Flask API that sends a daily email to users with a weather report for that day

Users can sign up to receive an email with a weather report for a given location and time each day, that will read something like this:

Subject: 

Your Morning Weather Report for Tuesday, January 08

Message:

Today's weather is expected to be a clear sky, with a high of 22.87 degrees and a low of 27.1 degrees Fahrenheit.

Wind speed is expected to be 5.01 mph.

### State of the project

This project is still in a very early stage. The WT Forms in the templates do function, but the front end is nowhere near fully built out. Additional routes also need to be added to the backend, such as a route for users to delete their account.
